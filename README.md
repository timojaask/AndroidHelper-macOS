# AndroidHelper-macOS
Running Android dev related commands from a GUI, just for fun? 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♂️

Just wanted to build something for macOS, was frustrated with how broken Android Studio build system was, and got tired of typing in command line, so I built this. Fairly raw thing. Sort of works for compiling and running Android project.
