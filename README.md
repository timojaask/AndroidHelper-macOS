# AndroidHelper-macOS
Running Android dev related commands from a GUI, just for fun? 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♂️

## Next tasks
- Update tests to reflect new functionality
- Add ability to cancel currently running task (e.g. clicked assemble by accident, don't want to wait until it finishes)
- Add ability to start and stop emulators
- Auto-refresh list of active targets
- Make use of the "offline/device" status of running targets -- perhaps wait until a target becomes active
