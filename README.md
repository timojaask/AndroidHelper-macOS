# AndroidHelper-macOS
Running Android dev related commands from a GUI, just for fun? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Next tasks
- Provide solutions for various setup issues: Installing and finding Android tools paths, things like apkanalyzer failing because either $JAVA_HOME is not set or using incompatible java version.
- Before heavily investing in writing unit tests, one of the next thing to do should probably be making commands more general purpose, preparing them to become standalone libraries. So this would include: adb path, app package name, app activity (done: module, variant )
- Add paralellize flag instead of having --parallel always on
- Handle situations when things are not okay. For example when target not selected, but user is trying to install or start. Currently nothing is happenning, no error message.
- The state update logic is important, so spend tome time making it readable
- Update tests to reflect new functionality
- Add ability to cancel currently running task (e.g. clicked assemble by accident, don't want to wait until it finishes)
- Display human readable device names instead of serial numbers
- Add ability to start and stop emulators.
- Auto-refresh list of active targets
- Make use of the "offline/device" status of running targets -- perhaps wait until a target becomes active
- Save project preferences inside the project directory, and cache parsed modules and variants
- Add ability to easily open previously saved projects
- Pick out relevant information from the log, such as build errors and warnings
- Extract command running and parsing into some kind of AndroidHelperAPI module. For example, right now ViewController has some business logic in refreshTargets function.
- Add install without building option (for cases where you want to install the same build on multiple devices). Maybe can use the latest built APK for a given module.
- See if I can make use of ADB `display-size` and `display-density` commands (https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb)

## Notes

### Launching the app

Tool: ADB ([documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb))
Command:

You can't start your app using `adb -s "emulator-5554" shell am start -a android.intent.action.MAIN`, because the device wouldn't know what app to launch using this action. If you run this, Android will ask you to pick an app, and you can set that app as the default for this action, but this doesn't sound like a good idea.

What's really needed is knowing the package and activity name. Package alone is not always enough, because if you have LeakCanary enabled, it's installed automatically together with the app and has the same package as the app. Thus trying to launch with just package name will likely launch the LeakCanary app instead of the actual app.

#### Getting package and activity
Both are defined in module's `AndroidManifest.xml`. We can find it under `[module-name]/src/main` and `[module-name]/src/[variant]` and probably some other places, and I think these get merged and they override each other in a certain way. Sounds complicated.

We can get the final compiled version of `AndroidManifest.xml` from the app APK. The APK can be found under `[module]/build/outputs/apk/[productFlavor]/[buildType]/****.apk` or `[module]/build/outputs/apk/[buildType]` is there's no defined product flavors in this project. This makes it slightly problematic. Maybe the way to go here is to search recursively for last created `*.apk` file under `[module]/build/outputs/apk/`

### AVD device error

Looks like once an AVD device got corrupted somehow. I was still able to launch it using `emulator`, but `avdmanager` would return an error.
Looks like this is the same as described in this StackOverflow post: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40113449/new-emulator-in-avd-manager-gives-no-longer-exists-as-a-device
